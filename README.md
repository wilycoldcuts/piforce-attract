piforce-attract
===============

This is a fork of PiforceTools that replaces the Adafruit LCD Plate with an HDMI screen running the Attract Mode front-end.  It still relies on debugmode's triforce tools, but strips almost everything else out.


## Getting Started
Full instructions coming soon.  For right now, see the thread at Arcade Forums.

## Credits
I didn't do anything special here - none of this would be possible without the following people:
debugmode's triforcetools
travistyoj's piforcetools
dev-tty0's Piforce-Web
ShaneMC's naomipi
darksoft's Atomiswave conversions
